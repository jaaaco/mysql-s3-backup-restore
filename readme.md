# MySql S3 backup (with cron) / restore container

Container can work in cron-mode and wait-mode:

# Cron mode

Default mode, container will make backups according to CRON_SCHEDULE env variable. 

# Wait mode

In this mode cron is disabled, you may make backups / restores with docker exec (see below). 
To enable wait mode add command: /wait to your composition.

# Backup command

Container is making archive **in the same S3 file every time**.

If you want backup file retention enable Versioning on S3 bucket and create S3 Life Cycle Rules to permanently 
delete older version after certain number of days. 

To make backup when container is running in cron-mode or wait-mode:

```
docker exec -it <container-id> backup
```

# Restore command

```
docker exec -it <container-id> backup
```
